# BA780-Team4A
Repository for BA780 Team 4A

This repository is for a team assignment from BA780, a class in the M.S. Business Analytics program at Boston University. The class introduces the toolbox for business analysts, covering topics like Python for Data Science, BigQuery SQL, & Google Cloud Computing, and learning how to pre-process data & conduct exploratory data analysis.

This specfic project is an application of the cummalitive skills gained throughout the class. It was an open-ended project that had students tackle a business problem using the principles and skills we learnt in class, where the professor acted as the stakeholder. Our team chose a public dataset scraped from InsideAirBnb.com and tried to determine the best prices for AirBnB listings based on their respective features.

While the goal of the project was to predict AirBnB prices using machine learning, the goal and emphasis of the project was to practice, develop, and showcase skills around data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
